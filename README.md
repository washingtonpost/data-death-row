# About this story

To report this story, The Washington Post compiled a database of all the individuals on death row in the United States as of Nov. 13, 2024. Reporters pulled data from the websites of states with an active death row and filed requests for information from those that were not posted online.

The data includes more than 2,000 people sentenced to death in state courts, 40 prisoners sentenced to death in federal courts, and four sentenced to death by the military. One state, New Hampshire, has a person sentenced to death despite abolishing the death penalty in 2019. Three men are serving sentences for crimes in other jurisdictions, including two who are sentenced to death in a second place. They have only been counted once in the analysis for the story but are in the data twice.

Reporters also compiled data as of Nov. 13, 2024, from three states — California, Texas and North Carolina — on individuals who had been sentenced to death but were not executed. These states account for 44 percent of all current U.S. death row inmates. Reporters manually categorized the reason each individual left death row.
